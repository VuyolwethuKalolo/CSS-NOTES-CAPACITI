# CSS-NOTES-CAPACITI

Selectors: Used to target HTML elements for styling. They can target elements by tag name, class, ID, attribute, or relationship to other elements.

Properties: Attributes of elements that can be styled, such as color, font-size, background-color, padding, margin, etc.

Values: Settings applied to properties, such as red for color, 20px for size, #f1f1f1 for colors in hexadecimal format, etc.

Box Model: Every element in CSS is a rectangular box with content, padding, border, and margin areas. You can control these areas using properties like padding, border, and margin.

Display Property: Determines how an element is displayed in the document. Common values include block, inline, inline-block, flex, and grid.

Positioning: Allows you to place elements in specific positions on the page. Values include static, relative, absolute, and fixed.

Floats: Used to push an element to one side and allow content to wrap around it. It's commonly used for layouts but is being replaced by more modern techniques like flexbox and grid.

Flexbox: A layout model that allows you to design complex layouts more easily. It involves a parent container (display: flex;) and child elements (flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, etc.).

Grid: A two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create grid layouts with rows and columns. It provides more control over the layout compared to flexbox.

Media Queries: Used to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as screen size, orientation, or resolution. This allows for responsive web design.

Animations and Transitions: CSS allows you to animate elements or apply transitions to create dynamic effects. Properties like transition and animation are used for this purpose.

Variables: Introduced in CSS3, variables (--variable-name) allow you to define reusable values in your stylesheets.

Preprocessors: Tools like Sass and Less extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins, making CSS more maintainable and easier to write.

Postprocessors: Tools like Autoprefixer can be used to add vendor prefixes to your CSS automatically, ensuring compatibility with different browsers.

Frameworks and Libraries: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and libraries like Tailwind CSS provide pre-designed components and utility classes to speed up development and maintain consistency.
